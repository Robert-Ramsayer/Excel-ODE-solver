# Excel-ODE-solver
Runga-Kutta ODE function installed into excel

Welcome, to start with, this prgram has a GNU license attached to it. Please read the document for the exact details. For a breif summery, the program is free to download and use, but you need to give me a citation. 

2nd, the purpose of this program isn't to just add Runge-Kutta ODE solver to excel, I've seen that and it's ussually a clunky mess. This is adding a macro into excel that makes Solving ODE's in excel easy and fast. Within excel there's a program named visual basic, you can access it by opening up an excel sheet and pressing ALT+F11. A programming interface will open up and you can program new functions into excel. I programmed an ODE solver to impress a proffessor. 

In order to use this just download the excel file on my page, and open it up. When downloading it you may get a notice that there may be a virus in the file. There isn't, I wouldn't put my name on it if there was. But if your still concerned, there's another option I'll bring up in the next paragraph. When you open the file you'll get a notice at the top of the  excel sheet stating 'Warning, this program has macros in it.' My program is a Macro, it's nothing dangerous. Click on the Options button. You'll see 2 options. The first one is to keep marcos disabled which will be recomended. The Other is to inable macros. To use my program you'll need to enable them. Excel is so concerned becuase you're opening yourself up to a programming inviornment where one could make a virus, but one could also make any number of other things. I made an ODE solver. To use it, you need to let it work. 

Now if you're still suspecious, there is another option. I copied down the VBA program in the Runge-Kutta Program document. You can just open up an Excel sheet, press ALT+F11, right click on one the the excel sheets, insert, new macro, and then paste the code. 

AS for how to use it, you'll need to have the VBA page open, again ALT+F11. There are 2 Runge-Kutta programs. RK, for Runge-Kutta first order, and RKS for Runge Kutta Second order. Go to the f function for first order or the g funstion for the second order, enter the equation in the form (highest direvative = the rest of the equation) and then go the excel sheet type which ever function you chose, R
